# script to end an in-progress backup session. This is meant to be scheduled
# some hours after the nightly backup runs, so as to prevent it running over
# into the next day and hogging bandwidth.

# check whether there is an rsync job running, and if so kill it.
pkill rsync # kill the first one. (May be the 'once' job.)
sleep 60
pkill rsync # kill the second one if it runs.  

# the backup script should take care of everything else.
